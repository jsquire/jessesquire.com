### Licensing ###

The artifacts in this repository are offered under the MIT license, as described in the accompanying [license](./LICENSE "license") file.  Feel free to use the code in your own projects as you see fit.  Should they prove helpful or inspire you to iterate on them in creative ways, I find that to be a huge compliment.  We all build upon the work of those who have come before us.

In general, formal attribution for code assets is not necessary, though it is always appreciated.  The content of the site and blog posts were authored by Jesse Squire and I do request that you not re-post them to other sites and accompany any excerpts that you use with formal attribution.

I also ask, for both the code and content, that you not copy an item verbatim and pass it off as your own work.
