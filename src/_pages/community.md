These are the community guidelines for {{ site.url }} and are intended to facilitate an understanding on the ettiquitte expected of those who comment and participate in site activities.  

As a general overview, feedback and civil discussions are welcome.  Please treat others as you'd like to be treated.  

Add Value to a Discussion
------
Before posting, please ask yourself if what you're about to say adds value.  Some helpful questions to consider:
- Is it relevant to the topic?  
- Is this useful, constructive criticism?
- Have others already asked or said the same thing?
- If you did a quick internet search, could you find the answer to your question already out there?

Don't be a Jerk
------
People have different viewpoints and differing opinions on many topics, which is good.  Open discussion is a great way to circulate your views and be exposed to the different views of others.  Who knows, we may all just learn something.  

Please be respectful and civil; remember to **_criticize ideas, not people._**  Remember to avoid:
- Hate speech and intolerance
- Name-calling
- Ad hominem attacks
- Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content
- Knee-jerk contradiction
- Cross-posting the same thing multiple times

Comments that are judged to be hateful, inflammatory, or harassing may be removed. Like my mother always said: if you don’t have something nice to say, don't say anything at all.  

In addition, if a comment is way off-topic, clearly demonstrates that the poster did not read the article, or is obviously trolling then it is likely to be removed.  Extreme and/or repeat cases may warrant futher actions.

Moderation of Comments
------
If your comment does not immediately appear on the site after posting, it may have been flagged for review. There are several things which may cause a comment to be flagged; please keep that in mind before resubmitting the comment multiple times or contacting us about it.

- Use of any of the hate-speech and/or slurs that are blacklisted will automatically flag a comment so it won’t appear on our site. Sometimes these words are false-positives; these comments will be approved by a moderator when appropriate.
- Using a Disqus account without a verified email address will automatically flag a comment.
- Comments can also be flagged for review by other readers (please do not abuse this option for others that you simply disagree with, it makes moderation much more difficult).
- Sometimes things just get auto-flagged and we don’t know why.

Beyond Moderation
------
Though we strive to welcome everyone, sometimes, people must be banned for the good of the community.  The following actions may result in a ban:
- Personal attacks of any kind
- Threats against the author, moderators, or another reader, no matter how vague
- Racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of intolerance 
- Anything that can reasonably be considered spam
- Impersonating authors, moderators, and other readers
- It is at the moderators' discretion to ban anyone whom they determine to be a detriment to the atmosphere of the comments section, the site in general, and other readers
